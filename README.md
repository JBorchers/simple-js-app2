Pokedex project description:

The Pokedex App uses basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app displayes a list of Pokemon buttons--when clicked, a modal shows the Pokemon name, image, and details. The modal can then be closed by clicking the "close" button, clicking the "x" button, clicking outside of the modal, or by hitting the "esc" button on a keyboard.

Pokemon details are obtained through an existing API url (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=151). JavaScript functions search the API for the specified details to be shown in the modal.

Goals to improve this project:

1. Display the Pokemon list in a grid with multiple columns rather than one.
2. Add a loading spinner
3. Improve the Pokemon images to be higher quality
